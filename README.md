# Evaluating effectivenss of open prison services within the Offender Personality Disorder pathway. What drives success and failure in open prison services for high risk offenders?

***Process evaluation***

## Welcome!

Welcome! :tada::confetti_ball: 

Thank you for visiting the process evaluation project repository.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 

## What are we doing?

### The problem

* It is important to understand whether OPD services are delivering their intended outcomes
* We need to understand how people effectively reintegrate into society - what leads to failure for some, and success for others?
* We need to understand ***how*** specialist services work as well as ***if*** they are effective. 

This repository focuses on the ***how*** specialist services work through a process evaluation of specialist offender personality disorder services. 

### The solution

The process evaluation will:

* Help understand who uses the specialist service (reach)
* Evaluate whether the service is being implemented as intended (fidelity + dose)

The findings of the process evaluation will provide baseline information about the specilist service users as well as the implementation of the service. This will be tested against the structure of the logic model to compare intended to actual implementation. 

## Who are we?

I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London studying within the Wolfson Institute of Population Health. 

## What am I working on?

The process evaluation uses secondary data from multiple datasets and requires extensive cleaning and linking before any analysis can be conducted. 

* Data cleaning 
* Data linking 
* Data merging 
* Dealing with missing data 
* Developing summary statistics
